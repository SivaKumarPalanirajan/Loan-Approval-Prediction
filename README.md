# Loan Approval Predictor Using Random Forest with HP Tuning Comparisons along with Docker Implementation

The primary objective was to build a loan approval predictor which can utilize details provided by users and give predictions with utmost accuracy. Utilized features such as Loan Term and Cibil Score.

During the project, I also experimented with various Hyperparameter tuning techniques such as Optuna and Grid Search where I noticed huge performance differences. Sequentially I built a streamlit application after which I utilized Docker to containerize the application.
